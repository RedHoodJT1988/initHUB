# initHUB
A simple CLI tool that initializes git for your project.
The tool uses your terminal to ask a series of questions, the questions
are the most common ones asked when creating a repo on GitHub. Bitbucket
and GitLabs will be added over the course of time. With this package
you will no longer have to manually go to GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket
to create a repo and copy all of the commands like:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
it's all handled in with this tool.

# Install globally
```bash
npm i -g inithub
```

# Steps to install and use
Please clone or fork then clone from

Once you have cloned the repo follow these steps to run it locally and make sure its working on your
machine.
```bash
